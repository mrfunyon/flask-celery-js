# Flask Celery and Javascript

## Motivation

Often times front end applications are at the mercy of slow services and a way is needed to make those responses faster. A fake it until you make it type approach sometimes works. This project is a look from a primarially back-end developers perspective to make the front-end of a website more responsive. I am in no way an expert on javascript and am going to stumble my way through making a bridge application.

The final product will be available in the master branch of this repository.

### Whats going to be used?

- Python
    - Flask
    - Celery
- Docker
    - Docker-compose for services

    - Broker, message queue and result backend for Docker.
- Jquery
     - All the front-end stuff, as little as I possibly can using promises as much as possible
